# Hands-on .NET 6 preview with GitHub Codespaces

Long time, no blogging! Since [I've joined to Microsoft](https://stvansolano.github.io/2020/12/07/Work-at-an-awesome-place-I-am-joining-Microsoft/) I got a lot of fun & new things to learn and do :) But I'm back to code, write & share with the community.

As you may know, .NET 6 is coming on November 2020 and after //build 2021 the previews are revealing more and more details. Here are some, and

- C# 10 preview features
- Minimal APIs
- Linq & EF Core 6 previews
- .NET Maui
- And more

The tooling is getting a lot of awesome things, from CLI to VS Code, and Visual Studio 2022 on 64bit is now on Preview!

I took some time to give it a try and out it altogether in a new GitHub repo, which can be used with GitHub Codespaces and Docker so you don't have to install locally in your machine! 

Just open it from GitHub either VS Code (latest version preferarly) and you are ready to go!

Don't forget to open issues if something needs ny attention, and give it a star. Happy coding! 

P.D: I would be making progress and introduce changes in the repo as new previews got out. So stay refreshing/F5ing!
