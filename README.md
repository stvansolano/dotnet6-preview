## Hot to Use (.NET 6 Preview 4)

1) Go to https://github.com/stvansolano/dotnet6-preview and hit the "Use this template"
2) Give it a name
3) Start using it from GitHub Codespaces (Code -> Open With Codespaces) 

Alternatively, you can run it from VS Code from your machine! (Screenshot below)

## Running some samples

1) Make sure `dotnet` tooling is part of your $PATH

> export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/dotnet \
    && export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet
    
2) Browse the src/WebApi or create a new Web API from CLI

> dotnet new web -o src/WebApi

or
> cd src/WebApi

3) Then run it 
> dotnet watch
